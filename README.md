This function is simulated to show interaction between heart model introduced by [2] and Perfusion model [1].

To run this code, you need to identify three parameters:
first_int = int(input("please enter the first value of interval :"))
end_int = int(input("please enter the last value of interval :"))
num_split = int(input("please enter the number of splitting interval :"))

These parameters are used to determine an interval and number of intervals that models need to be run.
